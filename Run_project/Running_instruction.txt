running steps:
1. Change the home_path in initiate.sh to the path of the project folder. E.g. home_path='/home/username/Run_project'  Note: no space before and after "="; no "/" at the end of the path;
   Run initiate.sh by typing . initiate.sh
   Empty folders containing datasets will be created by running initiate.sh;
   Paths within all bash and python scripts will be changed automatically as well.

2. Download gridMET datasets to the GridMet folder under home_path/input_data/GridMet/ (which was created by Step.1). E.g. /home/username/Run_project/input_data/GridMet/

3. Download LOCA datasets to the LOCA folder under home_path/input_data/LOCA/ (which was created by Step.1). E.g. /home/username/Run_project/input_data/LOCA/

4. Copy one netCDF file of both GridMet and MACA to home_path/input_data/reference_cropland/, and  extract a single day's data of LOCA and create it with the name LOCA_reference_cropland.nc (because a single LOCA nc file contains decades of data); submit the job to mask non-almond croplands in a example LOCA netCDF, an example MACA netCDF, and an example GridMet netCDF by typing sbatch submit_mask.sh. 

5. submit job to process ACI of Gridmet by typing sbatch submit_Gridmet_ACI.sh

6. submit job to process ACI of LOCA by typing . run_LOCA_ACI.sh (this will take some time to complete the job submitting since we submit job for each LOCA model)

7. create gridmet_ACI.nc by typing python Gridmet_create_nc.py; create Gridmet.csv by typing python Gridmet_create_csv.py

8. run lasso regression analysis by typing sbatch submit_Almond_lasso.sh

9. create LOCA.nc by typing . run_LOCA_create_nc.sh; this should generate _hist_ACI.nc, _ssp245_ACI.nc, _ssp585_ACI.nc for each cliamte model

10. create LOCA.csv by typing python LOCA_create_csv.py

11. run LOCA_projection.py by typing sbatch submit_LOCA_projection.sh to generate simulated yields for LOCA

12. run aci_contribution_LOCA.py by typing sbatch submit_aci_contribution.sh to calculate contribution of each ACI

13. Run the simulation for MACA by excuting steps 7,9,10,11, and 12 but replacing "LOCA" by "MACA" in the file name.

14. create plots by typing python plot.py
