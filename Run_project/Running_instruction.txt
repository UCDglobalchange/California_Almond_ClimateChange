running steps:
1. Change the home_path in initiate.sh to the path of the project folder. E.g. home_path='/home/username/Run_project'  Note: no space before and after "="; no "/" at the end of the path;
   Run initiate.sh by typing . initiate.sh
   Empty folders containing datasets will be created by running initiate.sh;
   Paths within all bash and python scripts will be changed automatically as well.

2. Download gridMET datasets to the GridMet folder under home_path/input_data/GridMet/ (which was created by Step.1). E.g. /home/username/Run_project/input_data/GridMet/

3. Download MACA datasets to the GridMet folder under home_path/input_data/MACA/ (which was created by Step.1). E.g. /home/username/Run_project/input_data/MACA/

4. Copy the MACA file macav2metdata_tasmin_bcc-csm1-1_r1i1p1_historical_1950_1954_CONUS_daily.nc from home_path/input_data/MACA/ to home_path/input_data/MACA/reference_cropland/ 

5. submit job to process ACI of Gridmet by typing sbatch submit_Gridmet_ACI.sh

6. submit job to process ACI of MACA by typing . run_MACA_ACI.sh (this will take some time to complete the job submitting since we submit job for each MACA model)

7. create gridmet_ACI.nc by typing python Gridmet_create_nc.py; create Gridmet.csv by typing python Gridmet_create_csv.py

8. run lasso regression analysis by typing sbatch submit_Almond_lasso.sh

9. create MACA.nc by typing . run_MACA_create_nc.sh; this should generate _hist_ACI.nc, _rcp45_ACI.nc, _rcp85_ACI.nc for each cliamte model

1. replace the data_ID with customized ID (I usually use date) in initiate.sh; make sure use single quotation mark such as '11_19'. 
2. type . initiate.sh to run. The data_ID in python scripts will be replaced and the folder containing outputs will be created under the name of 
   data_ID in the folder saved_data.
3. submit job to process ACI of Gridmet by typing sbatch submit_Gridmet_ACI.sh
4. submit job to process ACI of MACA by typing . run_MACA_ACI.sh (this will take some time to complete the job submitting since we submit job for each MACA model)
5. make sure both Gridmet and MACA ACIs are available in /saved_data/data_ID folder; there are 17 climate models folders in MACA_ACI 
6. create gridmet_ACI.nc by typing python Gridmet_create_nc.py; create Gridmet.csv by typing python Gridmet_create_csv.py
7. run lasso regression analysis by typing sbatch submit_Almond_lasso.sh
8. make sure 1000 lasso statistical models were created by checking /saved_data/data_ID/lasso_model/; Each lasso model should contain 4 csv files: coef_, score_, score_train_, score_test_
9. create MACA.nc by typing . run_MACA_create_nc.sh; this should generate _hist_ACI.nc, _rcp45_ACI.nc, _rcp85_ACI.nc for each cliamte model
10. convert MACA nc to csv by typing python MACA_create_csv.py
11. project almond yield based on MACA models by typing sbatch submit_MACA_projection.sh
12. generate plots by typing python plot.py
